# Wownero Spelunker

This is a Tkinter Python GUI front end for XMRig. It can mine either Wownero or Monero. It is generally unoptimizedoptimized and designed to basically paste an address in and start mining.

If you want to increase hashrate you can try increasing the number of threads. You can also try turning on hugepages, but it might just crash the program. Really not sure.

Basically copy in your address, change number of threads if you want, and then press Start button.
